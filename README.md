img2ngrv - Iamge to Engraver Raster &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/con-f-use/img2ngrv.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/con-f-use/img2ngrv) [![Build Status](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
=======================

Convert a pixel or vector image to [G-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) as commonly used by home-made (laser) engraving machines.

This particular code is tested with the [LulzBot](https://www.lulzbot.com/)
3D printers modified for laser engraving with one of the kits sold by
[J Tech Photonics](https://jtechphotonics.com/). The software is similar in end result to their
[LaserEtch](https://jtechphotonics.com/?product=laser-etch-bw-image-engraving-sw-license)
tool.

img2ngrv might support grayscale engraving once the demand arises.
